INTRODUCTION.	DET,PROPN,ADV,SPACE,PROPN,PUNCT,SPACE
ON February the First 1887, the Lady Vain was lost by collision
with a derelict when about the latitude 1 degree S. and longitude
107 degrees W.	ADP,PROPN,DET,ADJ,NUM,PUNCT,DET,PROPN,PROPN,VERB,VERB,ADP,NOUN,SPACE,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADV,ADP,DET,NOUN,NUM,NOUN,PROPN,CCONJ,NOUN,SPACE,NUM,NOUN,NOUN,SPACE
On January the Fifth, 1888--that is eleven months and four days after--my
uncle, Edward Prendick, a private gentleman, who certainly went
aboard the Lady Vain at Callao, and who had been considered drowned,
was picked up in latitude	ADP,PROPN,DET,PROPN,PUNCT,NUM,PUNCT,PUNCT,VERB,NUM,NOUN,CCONJ,NUM,NOUN,ADV,PUNCT,ADJ,SPACE,NOUN,PUNCT,PROPN,PROPN,PUNCT,DET,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,NOUN,ADV,VERB,SPACE,ADP,DET,PROPN,PROPN,ADP,PROPN,PUNCT,CCONJ,NOUN,VERB,VERB,VERB,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE,VERB,VERB,PART,ADP,NOUN
5 degrees 3' S. and longitude 101 degrees W.
in a small open boat of which the name was illegible, but which is
supposed to have belonged to the missing schooner Ipecacuanha.	NUM,NOUN,NUM,PUNCT,NOUN,CCONJ,VERB,NUM,NOUN,PROPN,SPACE,ADP,DET,ADJ,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,ADJ,DET,NOUN,VERB,ADJ,PUNCT,CCONJ,ADJ,VERB,SPACE,VERB,PART,VERB,VERB,ADP,DET,VERB,NOUN,PROPN,PUNCT,SPACE
He gave such a strange account of himself that he was supposed demented.	PRON,VERB,ADJ,DET,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,PRON,ADP,PRON,VERB,VERB,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE
Subsequently he alleged that his mind was a blank from the moment
of his escape from the Lady Vain.	ADV,PRON,VERB,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,VERB,DET,ADJ,ADP,DET,NOUN,SPACE,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,DET,PROPN,PROPN,PUNCT,SPACE
His case was discussed among
psychologists at the time as a curious instance of the lapse
of memory consequent upon physical and mental stress.	ADJ,NOUN,VERB,VERB,ADP,SPACE,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,SPACE,ADP,NOUN,ADJ,ADP,ADJ,CCONJ,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
The following narrative was found among his papers by the undersigned,
his nephew and heir, but unaccompanied by any definite request
for publication.	DET,ADJ,NOUN,VERB,VERB,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,DET,ADJ,PUNCT,SPACE,ADJ,NOUN,CCONJ,NOUN,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,SPACE,ADP,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
The only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was
picked up is Noble's Isle, a small volcanic islet and uninhabited.	DET,ADJ,NOUN,VERB,PART,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,ADJ,ADJ,NOUN,VERB,SPACE,VERB,PART,VERB,PROPN,PART,PROPN,PUNCT,DET,ADJ,ADJ,NOUN,CCONJ,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE
It was visited in 1891 by H. M. S. Scorpion.	PRON,VERB,VERB,ADP,NUM,ADP,PROPN,PROPN,PROPN,PROPN,PUNCT,SPACE
A party of sailors
then landed, but found nothing living thereon except certain curious
white moths, some hogs and rabbits, and some rather peculiar rats.	DET,NOUN,ADP,NOUN,SPACE,ADV,VERB,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,NOUN,VERB,NOUN,ADP,ADJ,ADJ,SPACE,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,DET,NOUN,CCONJ,NOUN,PUNCT,CCONJ,DET,ADV,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
So that this narrative is without confirmation in its most
essential particular.	ADV,ADP,DET,NOUN,VERB,ADP,NOUN,ADP,ADJ,ADJ,SPACE,ADJ,ADJ,PUNCT,SPACE
With that understood, there seems no harm
in putting this strange story before the public in accordance,
as I believe, with my uncle's intentions.	ADP,DET,VERB,PUNCT,ADV,VERB,DET,NOUN,SPACE,ADP,VERB,DET,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE,ADP,PRON,VERB,PUNCT,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,PART,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
There is at least this
much in its behalf:  my uncle passed out of human knowledge about
latitude 5 degrees S. and longitude 105 degrees E., and reappeared
in the same part of the ocean after a space of eleven months.	ADV,VERB,ADP,ADJ,DET,SPACE,ADJ,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE,ADJ,NOUN,VERB,ADP,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,SPACE,NOUN,NUM,NOUN,PROPN,CCONJ,VERB,NUM,NOUN,PROPN,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,SPACE,ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,NUM,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
In some way he must have lived during the interval.	ADP,DET,NOUN,PRON,VERB,VERB,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
And it seems that
a schooner called the Ipecacuanha with a drunken captain, John Davies,
did start from Africa with a puma and certain other animals aboard
in January, 1887, that the vessel was well known at several ports
in the South Pacific, and that it finally disappeared from those seas
(with a considerable amount of copra aboard), sailing to its unknown
fate from Bayna in December, 1887, a date that tallies entirely with my
uncle's story.

I DO not propose to add anything to what has already been written
concerning the loss of the "Lady Vain."	PRON,VERB,ADV,VERB,PART,VERB,NOUN,ADP,NOUN,VERB,ADV,VERB,VERB,SPACE,VERB,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,PUNCT,PROPN,PROPN,PUNCT,PUNCT,SPACE
As everyone knows,
she collided with a derelict when ten days out from Callao.	ADP,NOUN,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE,PRON,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADV,NUM,NOUN,ADV,ADP,PROPN,PUNCT,SPACE
The longboat, with seven of the crew, was picked up eighteen days after
by H. M. gunboat "Myrtle," and the story of their terrible privations
has become quite as well known as the far more horrible "Medusa" case.	DET,NOUN,PUNCT,ADP,NUM,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,VERB,VERB,PART,NUM,NOUN,ADP,SPACE,ADP,PROPN,PROPN,NOUN,PUNCT,PROPN,PUNCT,PUNCT,CCONJ,DET,NOUN,ADP,ADJ,ADJ,NOUN,SPACE,VERB,VERB,ADV,ADV,ADV,VERB,ADP,DET,ADV,ADV,ADJ,PUNCT,PROPN,PUNCT,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
But I have to add to the published story of the "Lady Vain"
another, possibly as horrible and far stranger.	CCONJ,PRON,VERB,PART,VERB,ADP,DET,VERB,NOUN,ADP,DET,PUNCT,PROPN,PROPN,PUNCT,SPACE,DET,PUNCT,ADV,ADP,ADJ,CCONJ,ADV,ADJ,PUNCT,SPACE
It has hitherto
been supposed that the four men who were in the dingey perished,
but this is incorrect.	PRON,VERB,ADV,SPACE,VERB,VERB,ADP,DET,NUM,NOUN,NOUN,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE,CCONJ,DET,VERB,ADJ,PUNCT,SPACE
I have the best of evidence for this assertion:	PRON,VERB,DET,ADJ,ADP,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
I was one of the four men.	PRON,VERB,NUM,ADP,DET,NUM,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
But in the first place I must state that there never were four men
in the dingey,--the number was three.	CCONJ,ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,PRON,VERB,VERB,ADP,ADV,ADV,VERB,NUM,NOUN,SPACE,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,DET,NOUN,VERB,NUM,PUNCT,SPACE
Constans, who was "seen
by the captain to jump into the gig,"{1} luckily for us and unluckily
for himself did not reach us.	PROPN,PUNCT,NOUN,VERB,PUNCT,VERB,SPACE,ADP,DET,NOUN,PART,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,ADV,ADP,PRON,CCONJ,ADV,SPACE,ADP,PRON,VERB,ADV,VERB,PRON,PUNCT,SPACE
He came down out of the tangle
of ropes under the stays of the smashed bowsprit, some small rope
caught his heel as he let go, and he hung for a moment head downward,
and then fell and struck a block or spar floating in the water.

We pulled towards him, but he never came up.	PRON,VERB,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,CCONJ,PRON,ADV,VERB,PART,PUNCT,SPACE

I say luckily for us he did not reach us, and I might almost
say luckily for himself; for we had only a small beaker
of water and some soddened ship's biscuits with us, so sudden
had been the alarm, so unprepared the ship for any disaster.	PRON,VERB,ADV,ADP,PRON,PRON,VERB,ADV,VERB,PRON,PUNCT,CCONJ,PRON,VERB,ADV,SPACE,VERB,ADV,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,ADP,PRON,VERB,ADV,DET,ADJ,NOUN,SPACE,ADP,NOUN,CCONJ,DET,VERB,NOUN,PART,NOUN,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,ADV,ADJ,SPACE,VERB,VERB,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,ADV,ADJ,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
We thought the people on the launch would be better provisioned
(though it seems they were not), and we tried to hail them.	PRON,VERB,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,VERB,VERB,ADV,VERB,SPACE,PUNCT,ADP,PRON,VERB,PRON,VERB,ADV,PUNCT,PUNCT,CCONJ,PRON,VERB,PART,VERB,PRON,PUNCT,SPACE
They could
not have heard us, and	PRON,VERB,SPACE,ADV,VERB,VERB,PRON,PUNCT,CCONJ
the next morning when the drizzle cleared,--which
was not until past midday,--we could see nothing of them.	DET,ADJ,NOUN,ADV,DET,NOUN,VERB,PUNCT,ADJ,SPACE,VERB,ADV,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,PRON,VERB,VERB,NOUN,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,SPACE
We could
not stand up to look about us, because of the pitching of the boat.	PRON,VERB,SPACE,ADV,VERB,PART,PART,VERB,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,ADP,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
The two other men who had escaped so far with me were a man named Helmar,
a passenger like myself, and a seaman whose name I don't know,--a short
sturdy man, with a stammer.	DET,NUM,ADJ,NOUN,NOUN,VERB,VERB,ADV,ADV,ADP,PRON,VERB,DET,NOUN,VERB,PROPN,PUNCT,SPACE,DET,NOUN,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,CCONJ,DET,NOUN,ADJ,NOUN,PRON,VERB,ADV,VERB,PUNCT,DET,ADJ,SPACE,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
We drifted famishing, and, after our water had come to an end,
tormented by an intolerable thirst, for eight days altogether.	PRON,VERB,VERB,PUNCT,CCONJ,PUNCT,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,VERB,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE,VERB,ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,ADP,NUM,NOUN,ADV,PUNCT,SPACE
After the second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm.	ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,DET,NOUN,VERB,ADV,ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
It is
quite impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days.	PRON,VERB,SPACE,ADV,ADJ,ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,PART,VERB,DET,NUM,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
He has not, luckily for himself, anything in his memory to imagine with.	PRON,VERB,ADV,PUNCT,ADV,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,NOUN,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,PART,VERB,ADP,PUNCT,SPACE
After the first day we said little to one another, and lay
in our places in the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched,
with eyes that grew larger and more haggard every day, the misery
and weakness gaining upon our companions.	ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,PRON,VERB,ADJ,ADP,NUM,DET,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,SPACE,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,CCONJ,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE,ADP,NOUN,ADJ,VERB,ADJ,CCONJ,ADV,ADJ,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,DET,NOUN,SPACE,CCONJ,NOUN,VERB,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
The sun became pitiless.	DET,NOUN,VERB,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
The water ended on the fourth day, and we were already thinking
strange things and saying them with our eyes; but it was, I think,
the sixth before Helmar gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking.

I remember our voices were dry and thin, so that we bent towards	PRON,VERB,ADJ,NOUN,VERB,ADJ,CCONJ,ADJ,PUNCT,ADP,ADP,PRON,VERB,ADP,SPACE
one another and spared our words.	NUM,DET,CCONJ,VERB,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
I stood out against it with all
my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and perishing together
among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar said that if his
proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor came round
to him.	PRON,VERB,PART,ADP,PRON,ADP,DET,SPACE,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,VERB,ADV,ADP,VERB,DET,NOUN,CCONJ,VERB,ADV,SPACE,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADJ,VERB,PRON,PUNCT,CCONJ,ADV,PROPN,VERB,ADP,ADP,ADJ,SPACE,NOUN,VERB,VERB,PRON,VERB,VERB,NOUN,PUNCT,DET,NOUN,VERB,ADV,SPACE,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,SPACE
I would not draw lots however, and in the night the sailor whispered
to Helmar again and again, and I sat in the bows with my clasp-knife
in my hand, though I doubt if I had the stuff in me to fight;
and in the morning I agreed to Helmar's proposal, and we handed
halfpence to find the odd man.

The lot fell upon the sailor;
but he was the strongest of us and would not abide by it, and attacked
Helmar with his hands.	DET,NOUN,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE,CCONJ,PRON,VERB,DET,ADJ,ADP,PRON,CCONJ,VERB,ADV,VERB,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,SPACE,PROPN,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
They grappled together and almost stood up.	PRON,VERB,ADV,CCONJ,ADV,VERB,PART,PUNCT,SPACE
I crawled along the boat to them, intending to help Helmar by grasping
the sailor's leg; but the sailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat,
and the two fell upon the gunwale and rolled overboard together.	PRON,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,VERB,PART,VERB,PROPN,ADP,VERB,SPACE,DET,NOUN,PART,NOUN,PUNCT,CCONJ,DET,NOUN,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE,CCONJ,DET,NUM,VERB,ADP,DET,NOUN,CCONJ,VERB,ADV,ADV,PUNCT,SPACE
They sank like stones.	PRON,VERB,ADP,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
I remember laughing at that, and wondering
why I laughed.	PRON,VERB,VERB,ADP,DET,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,SPACE,ADV,PRON,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE
The laugh caught me suddenly like a thing
from without.	DET,NOUN,VERB,PRON,ADV,ADP,DET,NOUN,SPACE,ADP,ADP,PUNCT,SPACE
I lay across one of the thwarts for I know not how long	PRON,VERB,ADP,NUM,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,PRON,VERB,ADV,ADV,ADJ

thinking that if I had the strength I would drink sea-water
and madden myself to die quickly.	PUNCT,SPACE,NOUN,ADP,ADP,PRON,VERB,DET,NOUN,PRON,VERB,VERB,NOUN,PUNCT,NOUN,SPACE,CCONJ,VERB,PRON,PART,VERB,ADV,PUNCT,SPACE
And even as I lay there I saw,
with no more interest than if it had been a picture	CCONJ,ADV,ADP,PRON,VERB,ADV,PRON,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE,ADP,DET,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,ADP,PRON,VERB,VERB,DET,NOUN
, a sail come
up towards me over the sky-line.	PUNCT,DET,NOUN,VERB,SPACE,PART,ADP,PRON,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,NOUN,PUNCT

and yet I remember all that happened, quite distinctly.	ADJ,NOUN,VERB,VERB,VERB,VERB,PUNCT,SPACE,CCONJ,ADV,PRON,VERB,DET,ADJ,VERB,PUNCT,ADV,ADV,PUNCT,SPACE
I remember how my head swayed with the seas, and the horizon
with the sail above it danced up and down; but I also remember
as distinctly that I had a persuasion that I was dead, and that I
thought what a jest it was that they should come too late by such
a little to catch me in my body.

For an endless period, as it seemed to me, I lay with my head

sailing dead into the wind.	PRON,VERB,VERB,ADP,CCONJ,ADJ,ADP,DET,VERB,NOUN,PUNCT,ADP,PRON,VERB,SPACE,NOUN,ADJ,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
It never entered my head to attempt

THE cabin in which I found myself was small and rather untidy.	DET,NOUN,ADP,ADJ,PRON,VERB,PRON,VERB,ADJ,CCONJ,ADV,ADJ,PUNCT,SPACE
A youngish man with flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured moustache,

He had watery grey eyes, oddly void of expression.	PRON,VERB,ADJ,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,ADV,ADJ,ADP,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE

It seemed that grotesque ugliness was an invariable character of
these islanders.	PRON,VERB,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,VERB,DET,ADJ,NOUN,ADP,SPACE,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE

the space of a minute.	ADV,PUNCT,VERB,NOUN,DET,ADP,ADP,NOUN,PUNCT,PRON,VERB,ADP,ADV,SPACE,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
Then, stopping to look back once or twice,
he slunk off among the bushes to the right of me, and I heard
the swish of the fronds grow faint in the distance and die away.	ADV,PUNCT,VERB,PART,VERB,ADV,ADV,CCONJ,ADV,PUNCT,SPACE,PRON,VERB,PART,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,CCONJ,PRON,VERB,SPACE,DET,NOUN,ADP,DET,NOUN,VERB,ADJ,ADP,DET,NOUN,CCONJ,VERB,ADV,PUNCT,SPACE

My drowsy tranquillity

I jumped to my feet.	PRON,VERB,ADP,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE
The apparition of this grotesque, half-bestial

I looked around me rather nervously, and regretted that I was unarmed.	PRON,VERB,ADP,PRON,ADV,ADV,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,ADP,PRON,VERB,ADJ,PUNCT,SPACE
Then I thought that the man I had just seen had been clothed
in bluish cloth, had not been naked as a savage would have been;

probably a peaceful character, that the dull ferocity of his countenance
belied him.

Presently I
heard an animal wailing again, and taking it to be the puma	ADV,PRON,SPACE,VERB,DET,NOUN,VERB,ADV,PUNCT,CCONJ,VERB,PRON,PART,VERB,DET,NOUN

Then suddenly traversing a little glade, I saw with an unpleasant start
two clumsy legs among the trees, walking with noiseless footsteps

Setting my teeth hard, I walked straight towards him.	VERB,ADJ,NOUN,ADV,PUNCT,PRON,VERB,ADV,ADP,PRON,PUNCT,SPACE
I was anxious not to show the fear that seemed chilling my backbone.	PRON,VERB,ADJ,ADV,PART,VERB,DET,NOUN,ADJ,VERB,VERB,ADJ,NOUN,PUNCT,SPACE

Then he turned

I gave one more look

The colourless clearness that comes after the sunset flush

Presently the trees grew thinner, and the shrubby undergrowth

smash in the lock of the smaller door and see what I could find

The daylight, the trailing

Neither the captain nor the mate would believe my story, judging that

My memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors,

I could not persuade myself
